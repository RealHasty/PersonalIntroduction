            <h2>Favorite Culture</h2>
            <p>My favorite culture that I am not native to would be Sweden. I like how people there really value nature, 
                balance, and taking time to slow down. Things like Midsummer celebrations and the idea of 
                just sitting down for coffee and pastries with friends, but they show how much 
                they care about enjoying life.</p>

            <h2>Historical Figures</h2>
            <p>Two historical figures I really look up to are Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Edison. Franklin's curiosity and
                knack for inventing new things make me want to keep learning and trying new ideas. Edison's persistence and
                creativity remind me that even when something doesn't work the first time, it's worth pushing through until it does.</p>

            <h2>Representitive Meal</h2>
            <p>A meal that represents me would be Milanesa. This is a meal that has a lot of meaning for me because it is a
                family type of recipe. It is a breaded meat dish that is often served with mashed potatoes or salad. 
                It is a meal that brings people together and is often made for special occasions or family gatherings.

            <h2>Most Creative</h2>
            <p>I feel the most creative when I have a clear understanding of the task at hand. Once I grasp the requirements, 
                I enjoy exploring new ideas and experimenting with different approaches to bring my ideas to life.</p>
